#### Github branching 
This helps you work on different versions of a reository at one time. For example you might want to add a new feature to your current project but you are unsure as to whether to make the changes or not. Branching allows you to move back and forth between the different versions of a project. Once you are done with the changes you can merge the changes from the new branch to the main branch (this is where the main project is by default)
